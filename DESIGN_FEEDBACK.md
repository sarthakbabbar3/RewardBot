| **Problem Stmt** | 15.0/15 |  |
| **Bot Description** | 10.0/10 |  |
| **Use Cases** | 15.0/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />No concerns about your use cases.  Well done.  Please proceed with Bot.md. the flip-side of UC3  (detecting PR negativity) is active research at FAANG -- cool! |
| **Wireframes** | 12.5/15 | Wireframes should be used just to show information layout, but this sequence appears to also show a thorough picture of all the use cases. Almost equivalent to the storyboard. |
| **Storyboard** | 15.0/15 | Good use of storyboard.  |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 22.5/30 | What you have is fine, but the milestone requires "This section should be several diagrams" |
