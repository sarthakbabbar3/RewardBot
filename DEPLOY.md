### USE CASE #3: Rewards for using Positive Words üéâ

The Reward Bot is designed to reward points for using positive words inside discord channel to build positive enforcement among usersü•≥. The use case flow is as follows:

- Go to discord server ```Team20Server``` and message using positive words like Thanks, Awesome, good, etc on the channel ```ta-test-channel```

![image](https://media.github.ncsu.edu/user/22719/files/a5fd7827-ca04-4565-8d48-c2e6e3b5d56f)

-  These words are then analyzed by the ```Sentiment``` library and the Reward Bot rewards the user for using positive words according to the degree of positive word used.

- If we use any negative words, then The Reward Bot will provide zero points to the user. To test this you can type any negative words and the bot wouldn't provide any points.

### USE CASE #4: Provides the self-statistics

The Reward Bot provides the self-statistics about the user personally and that includes individual details such as points for commits, issues, etc. The use case is as follows:

- Go to discord server ```Team20Server``` and type ```?self-stats``` on the ```ta-test-channel```.
