| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PRESENTATION** | 17.5/25 | First slide is text — don’t read text to your audience — they can probably read — use pictures.   This looks like it incentivizes lots of tiny commits — is that really the best practice you want?   How do you determine ‘positivity’?   Example: “Great job on message that awesome project up”?   Presentation would be better with more technical details. |
| **PEER PRESENTATION EVALUATIONS** | 10.0/10 | (If you did 4 or more, your bonus will be on your individual moodle grade.) |
| **REPORT** | 15.0/15 |  |
| **360 PEER EVALUATION** | 50.0/50 | (If your moodle score is significantly lower than your team score, you might not have submitted a 360 peer evaluation.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Total** | 92.5/100 |  |
